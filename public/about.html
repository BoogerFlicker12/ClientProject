    <h1>About Schedify</h1>
    <p>
      Each year, Poolesville High School hosts a symposium where seniors in the Science, Math, and Computer Science (SMCS) program present their summer internship experiences. The programâ€™s Junior Committee, which has historically had to manually create the schedules for these symposiums, has requested an automated system to generate presentation schedules.

    </p>
    <p>
      The project aims to develop a web-based scheduling tool compatible with ChromeOS and capable of generating structured and organized presentation schedules for all SMCS seniors, taking into account individual scheduling constraints. The system will streamline the scheduling process, reduce manual errors, and improve overall efficiency. This project has been assigned to a team of four sophomore students by the SMCS Junior Committee and faculty sponsor, Mr. Lee.
