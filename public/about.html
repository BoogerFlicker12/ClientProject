    <h1>About Schedify</h1>
    <p>
      Each year, Poolesville High School hosts a symposium where seniors in the Science, Math, and Computer Science
      (SMCS) program present their summer internship experiences. The program‚Äôs Junior Committee, which has historically
      had to manually create the schedules for these symposiums, has requested an automated system to generate
      presentation schedules.

    </p>
    <p>
      The project aims to develop a web-based scheduling tool compatible with ChromeOS and capable of generating
      structured and organized presentation schedules for all SMCS seniors, taking into account individual scheduling
      constraints. The system will streamline the scheduling process, reduce manual errors, and improve overall
      efficiency. This project has been assigned to a team of four sophomore students by the SMCS Junior Committee and
      faculty sponsor, Mr. Lee.
